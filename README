Matlab Implementation of Genetic Programming with the Push programming language
by Kyle Harrington (kyleh@cs.brandeis.edu), September 2011.

A very simple GP implementation that operates on a minimal Push implementation.

The default test problem is: X^6 - 2 * X^4 + X^2

To get started (in Matlab):
pushgp(5,1000)
